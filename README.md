Super-market frequent item sets
===============================

HOW TO USE
----------

1. clone from git
`git clone https://github.com/imdark/product_co_occurrence.git`
1. make a virtual env with python 3.3
1. run code 'main.py -i retail_25k.dat  -o out.dat'
1. the results will be written to out.dat

TODO
----
1. ~what algorithem to use~:
	1. apriori
	1. Eclat algorithm
	1. FP-growth algorithm

	currently given some experiments FP-growth algorithm seems to run the fastest given the data I tested it with and in general is considered 
	Best of breed in term of memory performance and otherwise

1. pydocs
1. python 3 types
1. clean up
1. ~unit tests~
1. fp_tree pruning
1. move everything to use yield where possible
1. input reading fails


steps to make FP-growth work:
-----------------------------
1. ~make sure it generates all permutations~ looks like working fine
1. ~add frquencies~
1. add conditions for frequencies
1. add limit on set size
